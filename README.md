## What did I do recently?

### Cloud Infrastructure
- Designed and implemented robust and highly available IaaS/PaaS services in Azure for both greenfield and brownfield environments.
- Developed comprehensive high-level and low-level design documentation, including architectural frameworks.
- Conducted thorough assessments of on-premises applications, designing and implementing end-to-end Azure infrastructures aligned with their specific requirements. Collaborated closely with customers to facilitate smooth migration of their applications from Windows and Linux systems to the designated Azure infrastructure.
- Formulated and executed cost optimization strategies for Azure services.
- Collaborated with product groups to ensure alignment of design strategies with upcoming feature releases.

### Infrastructure as code
- Designed and implemented a modular structure for customers, accommodating both shared and dedicated teams.
- Created Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform and Bicep for multiple projects, assuming the role of a maintainer for Terraform module repositories.

### DevOps
- Designed and implemented CI/CD flow (repos, pipelines, agent/runner infrastructure, release management) on Azure DevOps.
- Identified and addressed implementation, security, and operational risks during migration and IaC deployments, ensuring effective mitigation measures were put in place.
- Assisted team members and partners in resolving code and deployment issues.
- Developed custom Pester test cases to validate environments.
- Implemented effective branching and release strategies to enhance code development and integration processes.
- Established build system infrastructures to support diverse functional and security requirements.
- Established Azure DevOps organizations from inception, adhering to recommended practices.

### Kubernetes
- Designed and implemented highly available and secure private clusters with automated scaling for microservices on Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Authored Docker and Kubernetes manifest files for seamless deployment of microservices on Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Managed Kubernetes clusters and enhanced application security through the implementation of multiple security controls.
- Executed container and cluster compute optimization strategies for efficient operation of containers on Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Implemented managed Prometheus and Grafana services, leveraging their powerful capabilities to enhance monitoring, visualization, and alerting functionalities, ensuring optimal system performance and data-driven decision-making.

### Scripting
- Developed PowerShell scripts for consuming REST APIs, enabling interaction with services that lack native or third-party management tools.
- Implemented automated security checks, optimized image building processes, and enhanced container boot-up times.
- Developed PowerShell scripts from scratch and modified existing Shell scripts to automate application installations and configurations.

### Coaching/Mentoring

- Conducted technical sessions on Terraform for workgroup and internal IaC community members.
- Actively served as a subject matter expert (SME), providing assistance to colleagues in the Azure, Terraform, and DevOps communities.
  
### Contributions
- Made valuable contributions to the Terraform open-source community.

### Databases
- Designed and implemented Azure SQL solutions using Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instances. Successfully migrated on-premises SQL databases to Azure.

## What did I do earlier?

- Served as a virtualization (VMWare & Hyper-V) and server (Microsoft Windows) administrator, responsible for setting up, managing, and securing highly resilient on-prem infrastructures.
- Actively participated in migration initiatives, planning and implementing upgrades for operating systems and applications.
- Proactively identified design and configuration discrepancies during ongoing maintenance activities.
- Collaborated with stakeholders and security teams to deliver security posture dashboards, implement threat mitigations, and contribute to compromise recovery efforts.
- Developed scripts to automate tasks, reducing manual efforts. This included health checks, AD user account management, O365 mailbox management, Azure Managed Disk snapshot clean-up, cluster maintenance, Citrix XenDesktop maintenance tasks, and more.
- Managed CSP Azure subscriptions for multiple customers in an IaaS environment.
- Oversaw Windows updates lifecycle through WSUS and SCCM.
- Administered AD, DNS, and DHCP servers.
