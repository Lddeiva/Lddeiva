## What did I do recently?

### Cloud Infrastructure
- Designed and implemented robust and highly available IaaS/PaaS services in Azure for both 
greenfield and brownfield environments.
- Developed comprehensive high-level and low-level design documentation, including architectural 
frameworks.
- Conducted thorough assessments of on-premises applications, designing and implementing end-to-end Azure infrastructures aligned with their specific requirements. Collaborated closely with 
customers to facilitate smooth migration of their applications from Windows and Linux systems to 
the designated Azure infrastructure.
- Formulated and executed cost optimization strategies for Azure services.

### Infrastructure as code
- Created Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform and Bicep for multiple projects, assuming the 
role of a maintainer for Terraform module repositories. Made valuable contributions to the 
Terraform open-source community.

### DevOps
- Developed and implemented CI/CD pipelines on Azure DevOps, GitHub, and GitLab.
- Identified and addressed implementation, security, and operational risks during migration and IaC 
deployments, ensuring effective mitigation measures were put in place.
- Assisted team members and partners in resolving code and deployment issues.
- Developed custom Pester test cases to validate environments.
- Implemented effective branching and release strategies to enhance code development and 
integration processes.
- Established build system infrastructures to support diverse functional and security requirements.
- Established Azure DevOps organizations from inception, adhering to recommended practices.

### Kubernetes
- Authored Docker and Kubernetes manifest files for seamless deployment of microservices on Azure 
Kubernetes Service.
- Executed container compute optimization strategies for efficient operation of containers on Azure 
Kubernetes Service.

### Scripting
- Developed scripts for consuming REST APIs, enabling interaction with services that lack native or 
third-party management tools.
- Implemented automated security checks, optimized image building processes, and enhanced 
container boot-up times.
- Developed PowerShell scripts from scratch and modified existing Shell scripts to automate 
application installations and configurations.

### Contributions
- Conducted technical sessions on Terraform for workgroup and internal IaC community members.
- Actively served as a subject matter expert (SME), providing assistance to colleagues in the Azure, 
Terraform, and DevOps communities.
- Collaborated with product groups to ensure alignment of design strategies with upcoming feature 
releases

### Databases

Instances. Successfully migrated on-premises SQL databases to Azure.

## What did I do earlier?

- Served as a virtualization (VMWare & Hyper-V) and server (Microsoft Windows) administrator, 
responsible for setting up, managing, and securing highly resilient on-prem infrastructures.
- Actively participated in migration initiatives, planning and implementing upgrades for operating 
systems and applications.
- Proactively identified design and configuration discrepancies during ongoing maintenance activities.
- Collaborated with stakeholders and security teams to deliver security posture dashboards, 
implement threat mitigations, and contribute to compromise recovery efforts.
- Developed scripts to automate tasks, reducing manual efforts. This included health checks, AD user 
account management, O365 mailbox management, Azure Managed Disk snapshot clean-up, cluster 
maintenance, Citrix XenDesktop maintenance tasks, and more.
- Managed CSP Azure subscriptions for multiple customers in an IaaS environment.
- Oversaw Windows updates lifecycle through WSUS and SCCM.
